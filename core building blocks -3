 CAP THEROEM:
     The CAP theorem states that a distributed data store can only guarantee two out of three properties simultaneously: Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), Availability (every request receives a response, even if the data isn't the latest), and Partition Tolerance (the system continues to work despite network failures)
Consistency (C): Every read operation receives the most recent write or an error. All clients across the system see the same data simultaneously. 
Availability (A): Every request receives a response, ensuring the system is always operational, even if some nodes are down. 
Partition Tolerance (P): The system continues to operate even if communication breaks between nodes (a network partition). 

Consistent Hashing:
     Consistent Hashing is a technique used in distributed systems to efficiently distribute data across a dynamic set of nodes (like servers or cache nodes) while minimizing data movement when nodes are added or removed.
How Consistent Hashing Works

Hash space as a circle (0 to MAX_HASH, often called a hash ring).

Map servers to points on the ring using a hash function.

Map keys to points on the ring using the same hash function.

Assign a key to the first server clockwise from the key.
