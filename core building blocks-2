What is a Database?

A database is a system that stores, organizes, and manages data so applications can access it efficiently.

ðŸ’¡ Analogy:
Think of a library:

Books = Data

Library system = Database management system (DBMS)

Librarian = DBMS software helps you store, find, or update books quickly
Types of Databases
1. Relational Databases (SQL)

Data stored in tables (rows & columns).

Use Structured Query Language (SQL) for operations.

Strong data integrity & relationships.

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
  
 2. Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

Data stored in documents, key-value pairs, or graphs.

Flexible, scalable for huge datasets.

Examples: MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (wide column).
