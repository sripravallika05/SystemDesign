What is a Database?

A database is a system that stores, organizes, and manages data so applications can access it efficiently.

ðŸ’¡ Analogy:
Think of a library:

Books = Data

Library system = Database management system (DBMS)

Librarian = DBMS software helps you store, find, or update books quickly
Types of Databases
1. Relational Databases (SQL)

Data stored in tables (rows & columns).

Use Structured Query Language (SQL) for operations.

Strong data integrity & relationships.

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
  
 2. Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

Data stored in documents, key-value pairs, or graphs.

Flexible, scalable for huge datasets.

Examples: MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (wide column).

2. caching  
 Caching is storing frequently used data in a faster storage (usually memory) so it can be accessed quickly, without recomputing or fetching from a slow database.

ðŸ’¡ Analogy:
Imagine youâ€™re preparing for an exam:

Reading the whole textbook every time = slow (like querying DB).

Keeping short notes handy = fast (like cache).


3.Load balancing
  Load Balancing is the process of distributing incoming network traffic (user requests) across multiple servers so that no single server is overloaded.

ðŸ’¡ Analogy:
Think of a restaurant with many waiters:

If all customers go to one waiter, service is slow.

If customers are evenly distributed, everyone gets faster service.

The manager (load balancer) assigns customers to waiters.
example:
User opens app/website â†’ request goes to Load Balancer.

Load Balancer decides which server should handle it.

Request is served â†’ response goes back to user.

APT  GATEWAY :
An API Gateway is a server that acts as an entry point for clients to interact with backend services or microservices. 
It manages all the API requests, handles routing, security, rate limiting, and other cross-cutting concerns.

Key responsbilities
Request Routing   Authentication & Authorization  Rate Limiting & Throttling   Caching    Load Balancing   Monitoring & Logging

Popular API Gateway Solutions

Cloud-Based:

AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management, Google Cloud Endpoints

Open-Source / Self-Hosted:

Kong, NGINX, Tyk, Traefik, Zuul (Netflix)

-->>  Client sends request to API Gateway.

API Gateway authenticates the user.

Routes request to the relevant service(s).

Aggregates responses if needed and sends a single response back to the client.

2. Load Balancer :
 A load balancer is a system (hardware or software) that distributes incoming network traffic or requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
Types of Load Balancers:

Hardware Load Balancers â€“ Dedicated physical devices (less common today).

Software Load Balancers â€“ Run on regular servers (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy, Envoy).

Cloud Load Balancers â€“ Offered as a service (e.g., AWS ELB, Azure Load Balancer, GCP Load Balancer).
