1. Client–Server Model
   It’s the fundamental way the internet works.

Client = A device/program that requests something (browser, mobile app).

Server = A computer/system that provides a service or response.

How It Works (Basic Flow)

Client sends a request (e.g., type www.google.com).

Server processes the request (Google’s servers find the right data).

Server sends a response (HTML page, JSON data, etc.).

Client displays it (browser shows Google homepage).
