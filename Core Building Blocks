1. Client–Server Model
   It’s the fundamental way the internet works.

Client = A device/program that requests something (browser, mobile app).

Server = A computer/system that provides a service or response

How It Works (Basic Flow)

Client sends a request (e.g., type www.google.com).

Server processes the request (Google’s servers find the right data).

Server sends a response (HTML page, JSON data, etc.).

Client displays it (browser shows Google homepage).

2. What is an API?

An API is like a messenger that lets two software applications talk to each other.

It defines how to request something and what you’ll get back.

You don’t need to know the internal code — just how to “ask.”

💡 Analogy:
Think of a restaurant menu:

Menu (API) lists what you can order.

Kitchen (server) prepares the food.

You (client) just place the order; you don’t need to know the recipe.
